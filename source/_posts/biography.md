{% span logo blue h1, About %}

I am currently a Research Assistant in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University. I research Deep Learning on 3D Point Cloud algorithms, supervised by Prof. Fuxin Li.

<br/>

Previously, I was a Computer Vision Scientist at Clobotics Global, researching numerous feasible algorithms for Image Classification and Object Detection to improve the Product Recognition cloud engine for global consumer goods companies. Besides implementing state-of-art algorithms and optimizing its performance for the end-to-end AI product, I was a Machine Learning Engineer working on many AI system design tasks, such as Ceiling Analysis dashboards, Active Learning pipeline, Image Retrieval system, Distributed Data pipeline, and Online Learning pipeline. Moreover, I was a Software Development Engineer working on AI infrastructure development tasks, such as the Product Search website and Data Operations platform.

Weikun Han received an M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UCLA, supervised by Prof. Lei He. He received a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from Iowa State University, supervised by Prof. Liang Dong. He also received the IEEE NANO best student paper award, and he co-authored five publications in major journals and conferences during the undergraduate research study.
