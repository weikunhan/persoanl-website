{% span logo blue bold h1, About %}

I am a Research Assistant in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at Oregon State University. I work with Prof. Fuxin Li on 3D Point Cloud algorithms. 

Previously, I was a Computer Vision Scientist at Clobotics Global, working on multiple Computer Vision tasks (image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation) to provide an end-end AI solution for global consumer goods companies. Besides modeling many real-life challenging problems, I was a Machine Learning Engineer working on system design tasks (ceiling analysis dashboard, active learning pipeline, image retrieval system, distributed data pipeline, online learning pipeline). Moreover, I was a Software Development Engineer working on infrastructure development tasks (product search website, data operations platform). 

Weikun Han received an M.S. degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from UCLA, supervised by Prof. Lei He. He received a B.S. degree in Electrical Engineering from ISU, supervised by Prof. Liang Dong. He also received the IEEE NANO best student paper award, and he co-authored five publications in major journals and conferences during the undergraduate research study.
